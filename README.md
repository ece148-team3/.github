# ECE 148 Team 3 
What we have done:
1.Created a software processing pipeline that allows BEV image collection
2.Achieved a working prototype of image stitching using OpenCV stitcher
3.Calibrated the camera intrinsics and extrinsics
4.Collected data on campus at different scenes
5.TCP socket prototype completed, but not integrated into the real time loop
6.Deployed BEV projection code on Jetson w/ Cuda 
7.Partially implemented vision (depth map) only obstacle avoidance algorithm
